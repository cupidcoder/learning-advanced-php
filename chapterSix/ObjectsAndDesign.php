/********************   Design Basics **********************/

// Use of OOP does not imply Object oriented design

// Object-oriented programming through solid Object oriented design is preferrable to Proceedural programming because objects allow for
// individual components in a system to be independent of other components leading to a less-cohesive, decoupled and orthogonal system 


// -- Program to an interface, not to an implementation --


/*********** UML (Unified Modelling Language): Using diagrams to describe object-oriented architectures ***********/

// Graphical representation of an overview of an OOP design, indication the relationship and structure of classes (including their properties and methods)
