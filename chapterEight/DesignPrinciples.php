// Design patterns are primarily suited to solve problems that are unique and best suited to the design pattern, but in solving these problems, design patterns generally ensure that 
// the codebase promotes Reusability and Flexibility


/********* Composition: Using Composition and Aggregation to promote greater Flexibility **************/
//	Employing composition ensures a level of flexibility that inheritance alone cannot allow especially when classes take on multiple responsibilities

// Under composition, delegation means invoking another object's method inside a current instance to perform a specific task


/*********** Categories of Patterns: Categories of patterns to be discussed in this book ***********/

// 1. Generating objects
// 2. Organizing objects and classes
// 3. Task-oriented patterns
// 4. Enterprise patterns
// 5. Database patterns
